# rarelustchecker
There is a website called rarelust.com with one url that lists I believe over 30,000 obscure movie titles.
This program gets rarelust's current index and puts it into a list called queries.
Then it checks the movie's imdb duration and add a 5 minute range.
Then search youtube for the movie. Check the duration of the youtube video.
If a match is found, make a note and put a youtube link in the output.
