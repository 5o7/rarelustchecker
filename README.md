# rarelustchecker
There is a website called rarelust.com with one url listing over 30,000 obscure movie titles.
This program gets rarelust's current index and puts it into a list.
Then it checks the movie's imdb duration and adds a 5 minute range.
Then search youtube for the movie. Check the duration of the youtube video.
If a match is found, make a note to the output with a youtube link.
